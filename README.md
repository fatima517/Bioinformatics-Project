Analysis of Conserved Regions in Insulin Protein Sequences Across Species

The goal of this project is to analyze the insulin protein sequences from various species and identify conserved regions that could be essential for insulin's biological role.

Question: How have insulin protein sequences evolved across different species from a selection of species?
